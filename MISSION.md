# WHYLD — Mission

WHYLD exists to study and design intelligence systems that remain trustworthy under real-world conditions, not idealized assumptions.

The mission of WHYLD is to explore how intelligence can be:
- Governed before execution
- Resilient under failure and degradation
- Accountable through evidence, not probability
- Useful without continuous connectivity
- Safe without centralized control

WHYLD treats uncertainty, misuse, and failure as expected states—not edge cases.

This research is conducted to support long-term public trust, infrastructure resilience, and responsible deployment of advanced intelligence systems.

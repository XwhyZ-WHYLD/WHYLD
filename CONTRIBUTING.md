# Contributing to WHYLD

WHYLD is currently a research-led initiative with a tightly controlled scope.

At this stage:
- External contributions are not actively solicited
- Feedback may be provided via issues or discussions
- All contributions are evaluated against governance, safety, and constraint criteria

WHYLD prioritizes conceptual integrity over contribution volume.

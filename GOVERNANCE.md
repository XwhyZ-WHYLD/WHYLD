# WHYLD — Governance Model

WHYLD operates under a research governance model designed to preserve integrity, consistency, and long-term trust.

## Decision Authority
Research direction, scope changes, and framework evolution are stewarded by the core research architect(s) under XwhyZ.

## Change Control
Substantive changes to foundational documents are:
- reviewed for alignment with stated principles
- evaluated for unintended consequences
- versioned to preserve historical traceability

## Dispute Resolution
When internal or external disagreement arises:
- evidence and constraint alignment take precedence
- probabilistic appeal without evidence is insufficient
- abstention or deferral is preferred over forced resolution

## External Influence
WHYLD does not accept direction from commercial, political, or external stakeholders that would compromise its stated constraints or principles.

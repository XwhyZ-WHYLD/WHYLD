# WHYLD — Ethics & Constraints

WHYLD research is guided by the following ethical constraints:

## Governance First
No intelligence system should act without explicit governance determining when action is permitted.

## Evidence-Bound Outputs
Systems must distinguish between verified evidence and probabilistic inference. When evidence is insufficient, abstention is preferred.

## Failure as a Design Input
Failure, degradation, and misuse are treated as expected operational conditions, not exceptional cases.

## Privacy by Non-Collection
Where possible, systems should avoid collecting or retaining user data entirely.

## Non-Dominance
WHYLD research rejects architectures that require centralized dominance, irreversible control, or opaque authority.

These constraints are treated as non-negotiable design inputs.
